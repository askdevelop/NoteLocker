## Week 4, Henry notes
- This file needs significantly more edits, so I can match dates with attendance.php entries and ensure fair grades at end of trimester.
- You need much more progress. Deakin requires a minimum 10-14 hours per week, per unit, in order to pass.

## Week 5, Wednesday 3/April [Henry]
- This project needs more work to meet the pass hurdle.
- Include multi-line comments (/* */) before each function, to outline what the function does, any arguments and return types, and how to use it.

# Week 5, Sunday 7/April [Aditya]
- Created To-Do feature for the app this week. [Aditya Singh Kushwah]
